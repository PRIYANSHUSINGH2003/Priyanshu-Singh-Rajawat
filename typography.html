<p class="fst-italic lh-sm">Informally the role of teacher may be taken on by anyone (e.g. when showing a colleague how to perform a specific task). In some countries, teaching young people of school age may be carried out in an informal setting, such as within the family <a href="#" class="text-decoration-none">(homeschooling),</a> rather than in a formal setting such as a school or college. Some other professions may involve a significant amount of teaching (e.g. youth worker, pastor). <code>HTML</code> and <code>XML</code> or <Kbd>C<sup>++</sup></Kbd> weather <kbd>JAVA</kbd> </p>

<p class="font-monospace lh-sm">In most countries, formal teaching of students is usually carried out by paid professional teachers. This article focuses on those who are employed, as their main role, to teach others in a formal education context, such as at a school or other place of initial formal education or training.</p>
<h1 class="text-center mt-3 border border-5 border-danger bg-dark text-warning">Duties and functions</h1>
<p class="text-decoration-underline">Teaching is a highly complex activity.[2] This is partially because teaching is a social practice, that takes place in a specific context (time, place, culture, socio-political-economic situation etc.) and therefore is shaped by the values of that specific context.[3] Factors that influence what is expected (or required) of teachers include history and tradition, social views about the purpose of education, accepted theories about learning, etc.<sup>[4]</sup></p>
<span class="h1 bg-dark border border-4 border-warning text-info">Competences</span>
<p class="h3 mt-2">The competences required by a teacher are affected by the different ways in which the role is understood around the world. Broadly, there seem to be four models:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
    <li>the teacher as manager of instruction;</li>
    <li>the teacher as caring person;</li>
    <li>the teacher as expert learner; and</li>
    <li>the teacher as cultural and civic person.<sup>[5]</sup></li>
    <ul>
        <li>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has argued that it is necessary to develop a shared definition of the skills and knowledge required by teachers, in order to guide teachers' career-long education and professional development.[6] Some evidence-based international discussions have tried to reach such a common understanding. For example, the European Union has identified three broad areas of competences that teachers require:</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Working with others</li>
    <li>Working with knowledge, technology and information, and</li>
    <li>Working in and with society.<sup>[7]</sup></li>
</ul>
